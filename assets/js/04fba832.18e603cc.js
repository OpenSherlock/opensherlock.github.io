ASR is able to remember everything it reads without bloating databases.  It records each sentence one and only one time, but turns unique terms and predicates in that sentence into numeric identifiers just one time. Further processing is based on those identifiers.\nAnticipatory behaviors are model driven. That is, a reader's domain model, no matter how complete or sophisticated, is actively engaged in the reading process.  If the reader encounters something it did not expect, meaning, its model did not predict that event, then there is an expectation failure.  How the reader deals  with such failures is one way to think about intelligence gained from experience.

That might lead to finding the term online or by other means.  For ASR, that\'s not an expectation failure; the system simply creates a new Dictionary entry for it, and adds it to the WordGram graph.\nAnother kind of failure is one in which a statment encountered by a human contradicts what her model expected.  For ASR, that\'s not an expectation failure simply because the system records the new claim for what it is, then connects that claim to the one it contradicts with a "disagreesWith" coherence relation.  It is ASR\'s task to grow models as complete as possible, not to resolve contradictons.\nFor ASR, an important expectation failure is one in which an entire sentence does not parse.  That is, no nouns or noun phrases are found, and therefore, no claims are found.  That failure is passed to humans. In fact, not all sentences contain claims.\nFrom that, we see that ASR does not use its growing domain model in the way humans do; humans deal with expectation failures, whereas ASR uses them to grow the model with coherence relations where necessary.'),(0,r.kt)("h3",{id:"asr-agents"},"ASR Agents"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"ASR is a society of agents, each coordinated by passing messages on topic-centric channels over a Redis database.

A secondary reason is that some relationships, e.g. {A causes B} can be challenged.\nIn OpenSherlock's advanced rendition of the topic mapping paradigm, a relationship, formed by the triple of actor, relation, actor, is fully articulated in the SubjectProxy which represents the relationship itself.  It is addressable, as is any other topic, and can serve as an actor in other relationships.\nAll relationships, including the trivial taxonomic relation \"isA\" (subclassOf, instanceOf), have biographies and provenance.  Otherwise, they may just be unjustified guesses.\nTMRM allows us another liberty: we don't have to limit any topic to a singular object or relationship; whole graphs of, e.g. events can be subjects.
